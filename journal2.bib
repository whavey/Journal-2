	note = {time (min): {\textgreater}{\textgreater}2 verdict: keep Why: Interest in detection technology. Scan Results: This paper discussed a method to query environment data (network, and provenance) in real time. The authors propose a technology that streams in the data using a sliding window method and detects malicious activity in real time. Cost for critical read is high for length but low for understanding and the paper is very much related to my interests}
